java notes
What is Java?
Java is a popular and powerful programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!
Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
to heck java in cmd>java -version
now open the folder in cmd and write 'javac Main.java(file name)' to compile the main file
and "java Main" to run file
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.
Java uses the class name to find and run your code. System is a built-in Java class.
out is a member of System, short for "output".
println() is a method, short for "print line".
Finally, remember that each Java statement must end with a semicolon (;).
It's up to you which one you use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

Example
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
Be careful when combining text and numbers in the same line of code. Without parentheses, Java will treat the numbers as text after the first string:

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 6;

System.out.println("The sum is " + x + y);   // Prints: The sum is 56
System.out.println("The sum is " + (x + y)); // Prints: The sum is 11
A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data Type	Description
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

Example
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);
The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles:

Float Example
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);

Double Example
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);
The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only 6-7 decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 16 digits.

Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.
A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:

Example
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);
Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:

Example
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);
The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be null.
Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes etc.
The var Keyword
The var keyword was introduced in Java 10 (released in 2018).

The var keyword lets the compiler automatically detect the type of a variable based on the value you assign to it.

This helps you write cleaner code and avoid repeating types, especially for long or complex types.

For example, instead of writing int x = 5;, you can write:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
var x = 5;  // x is an int
System.out.println(x);
In Java, there are two main types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatic) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manual) - converting a larger type to a smaller type size
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
Widening Casting
Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type into a larger size type.

This works because there is no risk of losing information. For example, an int value can safely fit inside a double:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

System.out.println(myInt);    // Outputs 9
System.out.println(myDouble); // Outputs 9.0

Narrowing Casting
Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses () in front of the value.

This is required because narrowing may result in data loss (for example, dropping decimals when converting a double to an int):

Example
double myDouble = 9.78d;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

System.out.println(myDouble); // Outputs 9.78
System.out.println(myInt);    // Outputs 9
